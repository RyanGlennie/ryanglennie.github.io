    <h3 class="lead5"> Hi! My name is Ryan Glennie and I'm a first year IT web programming student at NSCC. After I finish college my goal is to be a web designer specializing in HTML and CSS. 
    I wanted to take web programming because In high school I was known as the tech whizz and one time I made a really cool website using google sites for a project that you can see clicking the link below. I thought that was really awesome and a super fun project (which I got a 100% on). 
    So I thought I would try to expand my knowledge on that and maybe turn it into a career! I would like to make companies amazing looking websites for their buisness! 
    I think coding is cool and all but my main interest/passion about web programming is the designing of a website and making it look super pretty!
